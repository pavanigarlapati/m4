# Schema Design Fundamentals – Relational Databases

## 1. What is Schema Design and What Does a Database Schema Represent?

Schema design is the process of planning and structuring how data will be stored in a relational database.  
A **database schema** represents the blueprint of the database. It defines:

- Tables
- Columns
- Data types
- Relationships between tables
- Constraints and rules

Example:  
A `users` schema may define columns like `id`, `name`, `email`, and rules such as `email` must be unique.

Schema design helps ensure that data is stored in a structured, organized, and meaningful way.

## 2. Why Schema Design is Required Before Writing Backend Code

Schema design should be done before backend development because backend logic depends completely on how data is stored.

If schema design is done later:
- APIs may need frequent changes
- Data may be duplicated or inconsistent
- Application logic becomes complex

Example:  
If you don’t decide relationships early (like users and orders), backend code may incorrectly store multiple copies of user data in the orders table.

Good schema design makes backend code:
- Simpler
- More reliable
- Easier to maintain

## 3. Impact of Poor Schema Design

Poor schema design negatively affects:

### Data Consistency
- Same data stored in multiple places
- Updates in one place may not reflect elsewhere

### Maintenance
- Hard to understand tables
- Difficult to add new features

### Scalability
- Performance issues with large data
- Complex queries due to bad relationships

Example:  
Storing user email inside every order row causes problems when the user changes their email.

## 4. Validations in Schema Design and Why Databases Enforce Them

Validations are rules applied to columns to ensure correct and reliable data.

Common validations:

- **NOT NULL** → prevents empty values  
- **UNIQUE** → avoids duplicate values  
- **DEFAULT** → assigns default value  
- **PRIMARY KEY** → uniquely identifies a row  

example:
email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
Databases enforce validations to:

Protect data integrity

Prevent invalid data entry

Reduce bugs in backend code

5. Difference Between Database Schema and Database Table
Schema	Table
Overall structure of the database	Stores actual data
Logical blueprint	Physical data storage
Includes tables, relationships, constraints	Consists of rows and columns

Example:

Schema → design of users, orders, products

Table → users table with rows of user data

6. Why a Table Should Represent Only One Entity

Each table should represent a single real-world entity to follow normalization rules.

Example:

users table → user information

orders table → order information

If a table represents multiple entities:

Data becomes duplicated

Updates become risky

Queries become confusing

7. Why Redundant or Derived Data Should Be Avoided

Redundant data means storing the same information multiple times.

Derived data is data that can be calculated from existing data.

Problems caused:

Data inconsistency

Storage waste

Update errors

Example:
Avoid storing total_price if it can be calculated from order items.

8. Importance of Choosing Correct Data Types

Choosing the correct data type ensures:

Efficient storage

Faster queries

Accurate data

Examples:

Use INTEGER for age, not TEXT

Use TIMESTAMP for dates

Use BOOLEAN for true/false values

Wrong data types can cause:

Validation issues

Performance problems

Logical errors
